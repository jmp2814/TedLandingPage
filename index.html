      <h2>The Boy of Our Dreams</h2>
      <p id="storyP">
        We rescued Ted on May 20, 2023. What we thought was going to be a 30 -
        40 pound Basset Hound x Beagle mix turned out to be a 75+ pound American
        English Coonhound x German Shepherd x Great Pyrenees. WHAT A TWIST. Ted
        has challenged us in ways we never thought possible, and changed us in
        ways we could have only dreamed of. When asked if I have any regrets
        about getting Ted, my answer is always the same:
        <strong>ABSOLUTELY NOT</strong>.
